# WeeklyPay
### Description
Fairy simple Java program to calculate the users weekly pay after taxes with the current Canadian Tax brackets. I created this program as many people turning 18 are facing taxes for the first time. When I was younger I wanted a better understanding on tax brackets worked and how they affected the overall take-home pay a person would get. This program should help anyone who just wants to play around with numbers and get a better understanding on how their money is affected by tax.
